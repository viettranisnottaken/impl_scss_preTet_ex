When margin collapse happens vertically (top + bottom margin)
1. if 2 elements are equal:
  - if both of which margins are negative or positive, the one with greater absolute margin 
  value overrides the other
  - if one is negative and one is positive, the margin = difference between the 2
2. if one element is a parent and the other is its child
 - if there is nothing between the parent's top/bottom margin and the child's top/bottom
  margin respectively, the parent's margin prevails
  - if there is anything between, they stack
  - if there is no content within the child then the child's margin goes outside the parent's
  if its absolute value is greater
