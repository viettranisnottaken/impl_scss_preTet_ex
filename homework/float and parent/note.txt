3 things to remember about float:
- Float elements do not conform to the normal flow (where elements lie on top of each other), 
they literally float above
- Because they dont conform to the normal flow, they are invisible to their parents. However,
their position is still bounded by the top and side edge of their parents, which is why they 
will try to be as close to the top left/right as possible, but will not extend outside of their
parent's edge.
- Contents (words and images, etc.) all steer clear from float elements, meaning you wont see
any float elements lie on top of contents. If the contents are added after float, they avoid 
element, if they are added before float, they push the float down
